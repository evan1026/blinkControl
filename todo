1.  Add "add button" to main window
2.  Maybe a printout to show what pattern is currently playing
3.  Code to allow for renaming
3.1 Change the main window updater to go alphabetically for refreshing when a pattern is renamed
4.  More clean-up
5.  Maybe some documenting comments
6.  Mutex per pattern rather than global mutex, or something like that
